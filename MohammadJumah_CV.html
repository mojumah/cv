            <h5>
                With over 10 years of experience in full-stack development and automation, I am a DevOps engineer who specializes in deploying, monitoring, and testing secure and efficient solutions for clients in various sectors. I have extensive knowledge and skills in using bleeding-edge DevSecOps tools and GitOps methods, such as Terraform, Jenkins, GitHub, SaltStack, PowerShell, and Bash. 
                In my most recent role at Accenture Technology UKI, I led the planning and administration of AWS game days, ensuring compliance with recovery time and recovery point objectives. I also developed infrastructure as code using CloudFormation, Service Catalogue, and Terraform to deploy applications on AWS, Azure, and Oracle clouds. I collaborated with the DevOps team to provide application support, disaster recovery runbooks, RDS and on-premises MySQL database restoration, and continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. I am passionate about migrating workloads from legacy infrastructure to the major cloud providers, following modern site reliability engineering guidelines, and automating manual procedures to reduce deployment lead time. I also have experience in front-end and back-end development using HTML, CSS, Python, React, PHP, as well as multilingual software support in English and Arabic.
